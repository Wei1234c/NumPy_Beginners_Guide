Chapter 1 of NumPy Beginners Guide.

Prerequisites:
   You should have Python and NumPy installed on your system.

There is one program in this chapter that demonstrates vector addition the Python way.
Run from the command line as follows
  
python vectorsum.py n

where n is an integer that specifies the size of the vectors. For example,

python vectorsum.py 1000

The first vector to be added contains the squares of 0 up to n. 
The second vector contains the cubes of 0 up to n.
The program prints the last 2 elements of the sum and the elapsed time.
